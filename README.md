# doconomy-reverse-engineered

This project is a homage to [doconomy.com](https://doconomy.com). I liked the site so much that I decided to recreate its essence using React/Next.js with the skills I have today. Think of it as a "what if" experiment for [asimov.cl](https://asimov.cl)—a raw, no-frills technical exploration.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```
bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- **app/**: Main application code.
- **components/**: Reusable UI components.
- **public/**: Static assets and files.

Feel free to explore the code and see how things work under the hood.
